# Problem Analysis for Maximizing Profit in a Sticker Collection Business
We are tasked with maximizing profit for a company that sells sticker collections. The company offers collections of different sizes (n = 200, 300, 400 stickers) and packages containing different numbers of stickers (k = 5, 6, 7, 8 stickers per package). Each package is sold at a specified price, and each sticker has a production cost of $0.02.

Objectives:
Simulate Buyer Behavior: Use Monte Carlo simulations to estimate how many packages a typical buyer will purchase on average.
Calculate Probabilities:
Determine the probability of receiving duplicate stickers in each package.
Calculate the probability of a buyer completing the entire collection within a total expenditure of 40 units (currency).
