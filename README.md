# simulation-monte-carlo
this is an analysis in a problem that we should solve as an analyst.The problem is to maximaze profit in a company and bring bussines solution 
we have collection stickers n=200,300,400 and pachages k=5,6,7,8 stickers and for each pachage have a sellingr price and for each have a product 
cost for different n,the cost of a pachage k is 0.02 so is 0.02.I simulate monte carlo for tou see how many pachage wiil buy be average the buyer
how is the probability too pich same sticker in each pachage and what is the probability to complete the collection with a total 40 amount.
